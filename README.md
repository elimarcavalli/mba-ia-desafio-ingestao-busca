## 💡 What is DocMind?

**DocMind transforms any PDF into an intelligent assistant that answers your questions instantly.** No more manual searching through lengthy documents!

Imagine having an expert who has read your entire document and can answer any question about it in seconds - that's DocMind.

### 🆚 Why is RAG superior?

| Approach               | Limitations                                   | DocMind (RAG)                                |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Keyword search**     | Finds only exact terms, ignores context       | ✅ Understands synonyms and semantic context |
| **ChatGPT directly**   | Invents information, no access to your docs   | ✅ Answers based 100% on your document       |
| **Manual reading**     | Slow, tiring, error-prone                     | ✅ Instant, accurate, never forgets          |
| **Traditional Ctrl+F** | Literal, doesn't understand complex questions | ✅ Answers questions in natural language     |

### 🔄 How it works:

1. 📄 You upload a PDF
2. 🧠 The system processes and "understands" the content using vector embeddings
3. 💬 You ask questions in natural language
4. 🔍 The system searches for the most semantically relevant passages
5. ✨ The AI generates a precise answer based only on the document

## 🎯 What is it for?

**Practical use cases:**

- 📚 **Students**: Ask questions about textbooks, books, and scientific articles
- 💼 **Professionals**: Quickly consult contracts, reports, and technical documentation
- 🔬 **Researchers**: Extract information from papers and academic documents
- 📋 **Companies**: Analyze manuals, policies, and corporate documents
- 🎓 **Teachers**: Prepare materials and clarify doubts about extensive content

**Example questions:**

- "What is the main topic of this document?"
- "What does the text say about [specific subject]?"
- "Summarize the main points"
- "What are the conclusions presented?"

## 🚀 How to Get Started

**Requirements:** [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed

It's super simple! Just 3 steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elimarcavalli/mba-ia-desafio-ingestao-busca.git

# 2. Enter the folder
cd mba-ia-desafio-ingestao-busca

# 3. Run the system
python3 main.py
```

### 📺 What you'll see when starting

When you run `python3 main.py`, an interactive menu will appear:

<pre>
<span style="color: #d946ef; font-weight: bold;">=== MBA Software Engineering with AI - Project Manager ===
GitHub: https://github.com/elimarcavalli/mba-ia-desafio-ingestao-busca.git</span>
1. Start System (Normal)
2. Force Restart (Kill existing + Start)
3. Quick Launch (Skip checks)
4. Stop All Processes (Kill Only)
5. Reset System (Wipe User Data & Config Only)
6. Exit

Select option (1-6):
</pre>

**For first run, choose option `1`**

The system will:

- ✅ Automatically create Python virtual environment
- ✅ Install all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Configure PostgreSQL database via Docker
- ✅ Ask for your API key (OpenAI or Google Gemini)
- ✅ Start the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

**Done!** In less than 2 minutes you'll be chatting with your documents! 🎉

## 🛠️ Technologies

| Component        | Technology             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Language         | Python 3.12+           |
| AI Framework     | LangChain              |
| Vector Database  | PostgreSQL + pgvector  |
| Web Interface    | Chainlit               |
| Containerization | Docker                 |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows **Clean Architecture** (Hexagonal Architecture):

- **Domain**: Pure business rules, no external dependencies
- **Application**: Use cases (Ingestion and Search)
- **Infrastructure**: Adapters for database and AI APIs
- **Presentation**: Web interface (Chainlit) and CLI

This ensures:

- ✅ Testable and maintainable code
- ✅ Easy switching of AI providers
- ✅ Scalability and performance
